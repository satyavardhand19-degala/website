He averaged 105 in the three-match ODI series against England Under-19s, while also averaging 49 in the 3-match Test series. Following India U-19 success in both the ODI and Test series, the team's coach Lalchand Rajput noted Kohli's adeptness in facing both pace and spin bowling and expressed his admiration for his technical prowess.

In July–August, India U-19 embarked on a tour for a tri-series against Sri Lanka Under-19s and Bangladesh Under-19s, where he did not score a half-century in any of the matches. He made a comeback with scores of 144 and an unbeaten 94 in the following Test series. <br>
    Kohli came into the limelight in 2008 when he led the team to victory in the U-19 World Cup. He led the Indian squad and won the 2008 U-19 World Cup held in Malaysia. He amassed 235 runs at an average of 47, ranking as the tournament's third-highest scorer and one of three cricketers to compile a century. His century, a knock of 100 runs off 74 balls, versus the West Indies Under-19s in a group stage encounter, was lauded by ESPNcricinfo, as "the innings of the tournament." This innings paved the way for India's 50-run triumph and fetched Kohli the man of the match award. Additionally, Kohli's all-round performance in the semi-final against New Zealand Under-19s, where he captured 2 wickets and contributed 43 runs in the run-chase, was core to India's victory.[31] In the championship match, Kohli managed a score of 19 against South Africa Under-19s and his contribution lead to the eventual 12-run win (via D/L method). <br>
    In June 2008, Kohli and his U-19 teammates Pradeep Sangwan and Tanmay Srivastava were awarded the Border–Gavaskar scholarship.

    <h2>International career</h2>
    <img src="assets/Virat Kohli career.png"><br>
    <p>Kohli's international career began in August 2008 when the 19-year-old had a "surprise call-up" to the ODI squad for a tour of Sri Lanka. He opened the batting due to injuries to senior players, scoring his first half-century in the fourth match. After a brief stint with the India A team, he scored a century against a strong Australian bowling line-up in a tour match.  Despite an early BCCI contract, Kohli's place in the team was not secure. A turning point came in the 2009 Emerging Players Tournament in Australia, where he was the top run-scorer, leading his team to victory with a century in the final. This performance cemented his return to the national side. He scored his maiden ODI century in December 2009 against Sri Lanka. By early 2010, he became the third Indian to score two ODI centuries before turning 22. <br>
    In 2010, Kohli was appointed vice-captain for a tri-series in Zimbabwe and became the then fastest Indian to score 1,000 ODI runs. After a dip in form during the 2010 Asia Cup, he solidified his position with consistent performances, finishing as India's leading ODI run-scorer for the year. Kohli played a crucial role in India's 2011 World Cup victory, scoring a century on his debut and a 35 in the final. Further made his Test debut in June 2011 against the West Indies, but struggled initially and was dropped. He was recalled and eventually found his footing, scoring his maiden Test century in Adelaide in January 2012. He continued to score runs in ODIs, with an unbeaten 133 against Sri Lanka and a career-best 183 against Pakistan in the 2012 Asia Cup, being the standout performances. <br>
    By 2013, Kohli was a linchpin of the Indian batting line-up, particularly in run-chases. He played a key role in India's 2013 Champions Trophy win and was appointed captain for the first time during a tri-series in the West Indies, where he scored his first century as skipper. He later established several records, including the fastest ODI century by an Indian. After a difficult tour of England in 2014 where he averaged 13.4, Kohli regained form and was named the full-time Test captain following MS Dhoni's retirement during the tour of Australia. In his first series as permanent captain, he scored three centuries in his first three innings, totaling 692 runs, the most by an Indian batsman in a Test series in Australia. He also remained consistent in the T20 format, earning the Man of the Tournament award at the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 for his 319 runs in the tournament. <br>
    Kohli's form in the lead-up to the World Cup was not at his best, however after a strong start to the 2015 World Cup with a century against Pakistan, Kohli's tournament ended with a score of 1 in the semi-final loss to Australia. A subsequent dip in form was followed by his first Test series win as captain in Sri Lanka. From 2016 to 2018, he entered a peak phase of his career. In 2016, he was the Player of the Tournament at the ICC World T20. He became the first batsman to score double centuries in four consecutive Test series and was appointed captain for the 2017 Champions Trophy, where India finished as runners-up. This period saw him break numerous records, including becoming the fastest to 8,000, 10,000, and 11,000 ODI runs. In 2018, he became the No. 1 ranked Test batsman and led India to first-ever Test series victory in Australia. By 2019, he became India's most successful Test captain, holding the ICC Test Mace for five consecutive years. He scored his 70th international century in November 2019, but this was followed by a prolonged lean patch. From 2020 to 2022, Kohli struggled for runs and stepped down from the T20I, ODI, and Test captaincy in succession. <br>
    Kohli's return to form began at the 2022 Asia Cup, where he scored his maiden T20I century, his first in any format in over 1,000 days. He was the highest run-scorer at the 2022 T20 World Cup, playing a impactful innings of 82* against Pakistan. His peak resurgence came at the 2023 World Cup on home soil where he was named the Player of the Tournament for scoring a record 765 runs in a single edition. During the tournament, he scored his 50th ODI hundred, surpassing Tendulkar's long-standing record. In next year's T20 World Cup; Kohli had a lean tournament, however delivered a player of the match performance in the final, scoring 76 as India won the trophy. Following the victory, he announced his retirement from T20 Internationals. In the 2025 Champions Trophy, Kohli was instrumental in India's victory, scoring a century and becoming the fastest to 14,000 ODI runs. India later secured the title. On May 12, 2025, after poor Border-Gavaskar Trophy performances he announced that the Test-series would be his last, marking his retirement from Test cricket. <br>

    <h2>Franchise career</h2>
    <img src="assets/Virat Kohli Franchise career.png"><br>
    <p>In the inaugural 2008 Indian Premier League season, Royal Challengers Bangalore, then owned by Vijay Mallya, acquired Kohli for $50,000 following his performances in the Under-19 World Cup. Kohli managed one run in the opening match against Kolkata Knight Riders and initially struggled in the middle order. A brief promotion to the top order in a match against the Deccan Chargers offered a glimpse of form, but he soon returned to his original position. He concluded the season with 165 runs, as Bangalore finished seventh in the league standings. In the 2009 season, Kohli began with a series of low scores but found form with a half-century in the third match. Despite limited opportunities, he made crucial contributions, notably in the semi-final victory over Chennai Super Kings. However, he was dismissed for 7 in the final, as Bangalore lost to Deccan Chargers by eight runs, finishing as runners-up.<br>
    The 2010 season saw Kohli elevated to the role of vice-captain. He emerged as a reliable middle-order batter and an athletic fielder, with a notable 58 against the Deccan Chargers. Bangalore reached the playoffs but were eliminated by Mumbai Indians in the semi-final, where Kohli was again dismissed for 7. In the 2010 Champions League T20, he delivered key performances, scoring 47 and 49* to help Bangalore reach the semi-finals before falling to Chennai. Ahead of the 2011 season, Kohli was the sole player retained by Bangalore for $1.8 million. After a steady start, he hit peak form with a string of impactful innings, including a half-century and consecutive Player of the Match awards. He also stepped in as captain during Daniel Vettori’s absence and earned praise for his leadership. Bangalore topped the league table and advanced to the final, where Kohli contributed 35 runs in a losing cause. He concluded the season with 557 runs, finishing as the second-highest run-scorer.<br>
    In the 2012 IPL season, Kohli experienced an inconsistent run, beginning with low scores before registering a few significant innings, including an unbeaten 73 against Delhi Daredevils as part of a then-record 203-run partnership with Gayle. Midway through the season, he assumed captaincy from Vettori but could not guide Bangalore into the playoffs, with the team falling short in their final league match. Kohli ended the campaign with 364 runs and expressed dissatisfaction with his performance, acknowledging the need for improvement. Promoted to full-time captain from the 2013 season, Kohli began with an unbeaten 93 and successive half-centuries, briefly taking his team to the top of the table. However, a mid-season slump, coupled with inconsistent bowling performances, derailed their campaign. Despite Kohli's individual scores, including a 99-run innings, Bangalore failed to qualify for the playoffs. Retained for ₹12.5 crore ahead of the 2014 season, Kohli endured one of his most challenging campaigns. Although he began with an unbeaten 49, his form deteriorated with a series of low scores and multiple ducks. Attempts to revive his form by opening the innings proved ineffective, and he registered only a single half-century in his twelfth match. With Bangalore heavily dependent on Kohli and Gayle, the team lost six of their first nine matches and was eventually eliminated from playoff contention. Kohli ended the season with a 73 against Chennai.<br>
    In the 2015 season, Kohli opened the batting for Bangalore alongside Gayle and maintained consistent returns, scoring 505 runs in 16 matches at an average of 45.90. His notable performances included an 82-run innings as part of a then-record 215-run partnership with AB de Villiers against Mumbai, and an unbeaten 44 in a rain-shortened fixture against Hyderabad. Under Kohli’s captaincy, Bangalore reached the playoffs but were eliminated in Qualifier 2 by Chennai. The 2016 season marked a significant phase in Kohli’s career. He began with a series of half-centuries and registered his maiden T20 century against Gujarat. Despite a slow start to the campaign, Bangalore staged a strong recovery, with Kohli scoring four centuries over the course of the tournament. He finished the season with a record 973 runs at an average of 81.08, claiming both the Orange Cap and the Most Valuable Player award. Bangalore reached the final but lost to Hyderabad by 8 runs.<br>
    At the onset of 2017 season, Kohli missed the opening three matches due to a shoulder injury but returned with a 62-run innings against Mumbai.Despite adding a few more half-centuries, Bangalore endured a difficult campaign, including being dismissed for league record of 49 against Kolkata. Kohli cited the team’s lack of intent and conservative approach as key concerns. Bangalore were eliminated early, finishing at the bottom of the table, with Kohli scoring 308 runs in 10 innings. That same year, he was named in ESPNcricinfo’s all-time IPL XI as part of the league’s tenth-anniversary recognitions. Ahead of 2018, Kohli was retained for ₹17 crore, making him the most expensive player at the time. He crossed the 500-run mark for a record fifth time and briefly held the Orange Cap, but Bangalore failed to advance beyond the league stage. Heavy reliance on Kohli and de Villiers, alongside an underperforming bowling unit, contributed to their early exit. The 2019 season began with Kohli moving down the order, a tactical change that did not yield the desired results. He later returned to form with a century and finished the season with a series of improved performances, but Bangalore had lost their first six matches and again failed to reach the playoffs. Kohli acknowledged the late improvement but pointed to ongoing issues in the middle order, leading to increased scrutiny over his long captaincy tenure.<br>
    Between 2020 and 2022, Kohli experienced mixed outcomes in the IPL. In the 2020 season, after a slow start, he delivered several steady innings that helped Bangalore qualify for the playoffs. However, his conservative strike rate and early dismissal in the eliminator contributed to the team's exit. In 2021, he began positively and reached multiple individual milestones, including becoming the first player to play 200 matches for Bangalore and surpassing 10,000 runs in T20 cricket. Midway through the season, Kohli announced his decision to step down from captaincy at the end of the campaign. Bangalore again reached the playoffs, but Kohli’s dip in form coincided with the team’s elimination. In 2022, under new captain Faf du Plessis, Kohli faced a prolonged lean patch, recording multiple low scores and three ducks, which is the joint-highest in a single season of his career. His struggles drew criticism from analysts and led to suggestions of taking a break from cricket. He responded with a 73-run innings in a must-win match that secured Bangalore a place in the playoffs, but failed to make a significant impact in the knockout games. The season concluded without a title, extending championship drought.<br>
    In the inaugural match of 2023 season, Kohli began with an unbeaten 82 against Mumbai and maintained steady form, registering five half-centuries in the first eight matches. His approach combined early aggression in the powerplay with a more measured tempo through the middle overs. He also briefly captained the side in Faf du Plessis’s absence. Despite ending the season with back-to-back centuries, surpassing Gayle’s record for most IPL hundreds. Bangalore failed to secure a playoff spot. Kohli concluded the campaign with 639 runs at an average of 53.2 and a strike rate of 140. Further in 2024, Kohli played in rhythm, scoring several fifties  and a career-best unbeaten 113 against Rajasthan, though it came in a defeat. Bangalore recovered from a six-match losing streak with a six-match winning streak to enter the playoffs, with Kohli contributing significantly, including a notable 92 off 47. He ended the season with 741 runs at 61.75, earning the Orange Cap for the second time. In the 2025 IPL season, Kohli scored 657 runs in 15 innings at an average of 54.75 and a strike rate of 146.5, finishing as the tournament's third-highest run-scorer. In the final against Punjab Kings, he contributed 43 runs off 35 balls as Bengaluru posted 190/9, eventually winning the match by six runs. The victory marked the franchise’s first IPL title, ending an 18-year wait. It was also Kohli’s first IPL championship in 18 seasons with the team.<br>
